**Official Plugins**  
Announcement, Application, Banner, Division, Downloads, Event  

**Upgrade Plugin**  
*A plugin loaded to upgrade existing data to latest version, mainly used when database structure is updated*  
Place "upgrade.py" in program directory, which contains **str** `target_version` and **def** `run`. Execute main program, it will detect if `target_version` match current version, then execute the `run` function.  

**About Banner**  
To save memory when running multiple Drivers Hub, banner is generated by `bannergen` in a separate process. It must be running so that banner function could work.  

**Code API**  
1.Authorization  
`auth(authorization, request, check_ip_address = True, allow_application_token = False, check_member = True, required_permission = ["admin", "driver"])`  
returns `{error: bool, discordid: int, userid: int, name: str, roles: list, application_token: bool}`  
2.Rate limit  
`ratelimit(ip, endpoint, limittime, limitcnt)`  
returns `rate_limit_timeout: int`
